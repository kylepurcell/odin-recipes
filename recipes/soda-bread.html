        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>From the Society for the Preservation of Irish Soda Bread</p>
        <p>This is a delicious and incredibly simple bread to make. The soda and buttermilk react to give it the rise it needs. Since there is no proofing time it's a quick bread to make. In less than an hour you can enjoy warm bread straight from the oven</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups (12 oz) of wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 cup (4 oz) of white flour</li>
            <li>14 ounces of buttermilk (pour in a bit at a time until the dough is moist)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda</li>
            <li>Optional: 2 ounces of butter if you want to deviate a bit </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Preheat the oven to 425 F. degrees. Lightly grease and flour a cake pan. In a large bowl sieve and combine all the dry ingredients. Rub in the butter (if using) until the flour is crumbly.</li>
           <li>Add the buttermilk to form a sticky dough. Place on flouredsurface and lightly knead (too much allows the gas to escape).Â </li>
           <li>Shape into a round flat shape in a round cake pan and cut a cross in the top of the dough.</li>
           <li>Cover the pan with another pan and bake for 30 minutes (this simulates the bastible pot). Remove cover and bake for an additional 15 minutes. </li>
           <li>The bottom of the bread will have a hollow sound when tapped to show it is done. </li>
           <li>Cover the bread in a tea towel and lightly sprinkle water on the cloth to keep the bread moist. </li>
           <li>Let cool and you are ready to have a buttered slice with a nice cup of tea or coffee.</li>
        </ol>
