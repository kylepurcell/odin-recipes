        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>From Melissa Clark's cookbook <em>Dinner</em>, this has become a favourite of mine.</p> 
        <p>Chicken, potatoes, and leeks, are tossed with a spicy harissa paste and all cooked together on one pan. A spicy, sweet, hearbacious dish perfect for summer.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and drumsticks</li>
            <li>1 1/4 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 by 1/2-inch chunks</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons harissa paste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>4 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin</li>
            <li>olive oil, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>2 leeks, white and light green parts, halved lengthwise, rinsed, and thinly sliced into half-moons</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>1/3 cup plain yogurt, preferably wholemilk (if using Greek, thin it down with a little milk to make it drizzle-able</li>
            <li>1 small garlic clover</li>
            <li>1 cup mixed soft fresh herbs such as dill,</li>
            <li>parsley, mint, and/or cilantro leaves</li>
            <li>Fresh lemon juice, as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the chicken and potatoes in a large bowl. Season them with 2½ teaspoons of the salt and ½ teaspoon of the pepper. In a small bowl, whisk together the harissa, cumin, and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Pour this mixture over the chicken and potatoes, and toss to combine. Let it stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the leeks, lemon zest, ¼ teaspoon of the salt, and the remaining 1½ tablespoons olive oil.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 425°F. </li>
            <li>Arrange the chicken and potatoes in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes. Then toss the potatoes lightly and scatter the leeks over the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Roast until the chicken is cooked through and everything is golden and slightly crisped, 20 to 25 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>While the chicken cooks, place the yogurt in a small bowl. Grate the garlic clove over the yogurt, and season with the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper.</li>
            <li>Spoon the yogurt over the chicken and vegetables in the baking sheet (or you can transfer everything to a platter if you want to be fancy about it). Scatter the herbs over the yogurt, drizzle some olive oil and lemon juice over the top, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
